Welcome to my Python Battleship project!

I have attempted to create an interactive, user-friendly "Battleship" game in Python3

It features singleplayer and multiplayer modes, and offers an enemy AI with three different difficulty settings

#Note: Will add support for Battleship variants such as "Salvo"
